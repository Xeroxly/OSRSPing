# OSRSPing
A batch file that tests the ping of OSRS worlds in the Members West US area

Run the batch and it will ping Jagex's servers giving you the average ping for each world

Can easily be changed to other regions by changing the numbers in parathesis to those of other OSRS servers. (301=1, 201= 101, etc..)
